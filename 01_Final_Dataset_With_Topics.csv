40639092,Paper spray and direct mushroom spray mass spectrometry methods for the analysis of psycho-neurological disorder toxins.,"Fast screening approaches based on paper spray ionization were developed to identify psycho-neurological disorders mushrooms. Directly spraying from mushroom tissue already allowed direct identification of muscarine, psilocin, and ibotenic acid within 2-3 min. For quantitative analysis of the more challenging ibotenic acid, a new anion-exchange modified paper spray tandem mass spectrometry (AEPS-MS/MS) method was established to increase selectivity and sensitivity. The developed method was benchmarked against HPLC-MS/MS (with detection limits of 0.009 mug mL(-1)) and could reach detection limits of 1.3 mug mL(-1) for ibotenic acid spiked in mushroom extract, with acceptable accuracy (-14.0 % to +5.1 %) and precision (10.8 % to 18.0 %). In addition, the developed method was compared with solid-phase extraction coupled with PS-MS/MS (with detection limits of 2.8 mug mL(-1)).

39244363,"Surveillance of household foodborne disease outbreaks in Zhejiang Province, China, 2010-2022.","BACKGROUND: Foodborne diseases are a growing public health concern worldwide and households are a common setting. This study aimed to explore the epidemiological characteristics of household foodborne disease outbreaks in Zhejiang Province and propose targeted prevention and control measures. METHODS: Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze household foodborne disease outbreak data collected from the Foodborne Disease Outbreaks Surveillance System in Zhejiang Province from 2010 to 2022. RESULTS: Household foodborne disease outbreaks showed an upward trend during the study period (Cox-Staurt trend test, p = 0.01563 < 0.05). These outbreaks mainly occurred from June to September, with 62.08% (352/567) of all reported outbreaks. The number of reported outbreaks varied in 11 prefectures, with a maximum of 100 and a minimum of only 7. Household foodborne disease outbreaks had a wide spectrum of etiologic factors. Mushroom toxins accounted for the largest proportion of all etiologies (43.39 %) and caused the highest proportion of hospitalization (54.18%) and death (78.26%). Such outbreaks are caused by accidently eating wild poisonous mushrooms. Bacterial infection (16.23%) was the second most common etiology, with Salmonella spp. and Vibrio parahaemolyticus being the primary pathogens. These outbreaks were caused by improper storage, improper processing or a combination of factors, and the foods involved were mainly aquatic animals, eggs and cooked meat. Other identified etiologies included plant toxins (9.52%), chemicals (7.23%), animal toxins (3.70%), and viruses (1.76%). Among the above-mentioned etiologies, mushroom toxins, bacteria, and animal toxins had seasonal characteristics. Analysis of regions and etiologies revealed that the proportion of various etiologies was different in 11 prefectures. Wild mushrooms (43.39%), aquatic animals (9.88%), and toxic plants (8.47%) were the top three foods involved in these outbreaks.

36927530,The epidemiology of wild mushroom poisoning in Israel.,"Wild mushroom (macrofungi) picking has become a popular activity in Israel in recent years. Besides the estimated 135 edible species, the mycobiota of Israel includes also around 65 poisonous and potentially dangerous species. We conducted a long-term retrospective study to monitor the frequency, severity, seasonal character, species composition, and geographic distribution of mushroom exposure and poisoning in Israel. Using data collected by the Israel Poison Information Center in Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, during the years 2010-2021, we report that only 4% of cases of exposures due to biological agents were caused by mushrooms. Males were significantly (P < 0.004) more affected than females. Most cases involved either above 18 years of age (41%) or below the age of 6 years (39%). Most of the children under 6 years of age did not develop signs or symptoms of toxicity. During 2017-2021, 128 cases (82.5%) involved the consumption of raw mushrooms, mostly by children under 6 years of age. The most common season of mushroom exposure was rainy winters (P < 0.05).

35800559,Delayed liver toxicity and delayed gastroenteritis: A 5 year retrospective analysis of the cause of death in Mushroom poisoning.,"INTRODUCTION: Mushroom poisoning occurs from consumption of the wild variants of mushroom containing varied forms of toxins. Among those toxins, amatoxin containing mushrooms are known for the significant morbidity and mortality from hepatic toxicity and delayed gastroenteritis. Although not a very common cause of poisoning, it is prevalent in the north-eastern region of India, especially during the rainy summer seasons when the wild variants are found abundantly and often confused with the edible variants. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical and biochemical profiles and short term outcomes of patients with mushroom poisoning admitted to a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the data of patients with mushroom poisoning admitted to a tertiary care institute in north-eastern India between January 2015 to December 2020 to study their clinical and biochemical profiles, and short-term outcomes. Their clinical features, biochemical parameters, management, and in-hospital outcomes were noted. All data was recorded in Microsoft MS Excel and analyses done using SPSS version 22. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients with mushroom poisoning, 23 (52%) were male and 21 (47%) were female, with a mean age of 20.13 years. Seventeen patients (38%) had delayed liver failure and delayed gastroenteritis, 19 patients (43%) had acute gastroenteritis syndrome, 5 patients (11%) had cholinergic symptoms, one patient (2%) each had acute kidney injury and a disulfiram-type reaction with headache. The mean hospital stay of the patients was 5 days. In-hospital mortality occurred in 10 (58%) patients with delayed liver failure and none of the patients with the other complications died. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high prevalence of mushroom poisoning that caused delayed liver toxicity and delayed gastroenteritis, probably amatoxin-induced, which is fatal, thus accounting for high mortality and poor outcomes in these patients.",Journal of family medicine and primary care,2022,Tiewsoh I; Bhattacharya PK; Barman B; Barman H; Rapthap K; Sangla L; Lynrah KG,Amatoxin; Northeast India; mushroom; poisoning; syndromes,,Journal Article,Delayed liver toxicity and delayed gastroenteritis: A 5 year retrospective analysis of the cause of death in Mushroom poisoning.,"INTRODUCTION: Mushroom poisoning occurs from consumption of the wild variants of mushroom containing varied forms of toxins.

31561486,Fatal Immunohaemolysis after the Consumption of the Poison Pax Mushroom: A Focus on the Diagnosis of the Paxillus Syndrome with the Aid of Two Case Reports.,"This retrospective report focuses on the diagnosis of the Paxillus syndrome, based on two fatal cases of haemolysis following the consumption of Paxillus involutus. These mushrooms are still consumed regularly, despite earlier reports of life-threatening autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Such cases are nevertheless rare, and thus far no toxin could be identified that causes this unusual form of mushroom poisoning. All these factors contribute to the difficulty in diagnosing the Paxillus syndrome. The following aspects support the diagnosis in the two cases presented here: Both patients consumed the mushroom oftentimes before, yet allegedly without ill effects. Symptoms occurred 2-3 h after the last consumption, exacerbating into circulatory collapse, multiorgan failure, and death. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was identified as cause of death by autopsy of patient 1. Patient 2 died of multiorgan failure, mainly hepatic. Our mycological analyses could identify the consumed mushroom in both cases as Paxillus involutus. Furthermore, we could exclude anticoagulants and several other drugs as trigger for the haemolysis by post-mortem toxicological analysis. However, findings in each of the two cases may have led to the haemolysis, independent of the consumption of Paxillus involutus. Patient 1 carried the anti-erythrocytic antibody, auto-anti-e. Patient 2 contracted chronic hepatitis C years prior to the current incident. Considering the rarity of the Paxillus syndrome, our findings suggest that these patients were particularly susceptible for haemolysis after consuming this mushroom over a prolonged period.

35154529,Acute liver failure secondary to toxic exposure in children.,"INTRODUCTION: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a syndrome defined by jaundice, coagulopathy (INR > 1.5) and hepatic encephalopathy in patients with no evidence of prior liver disease. Toxins and drugs are a frequent cause of ALF in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The aim of our study was to establish the causes of toxic ALF in children followed up in our hospital in the period of January 2000 to August 2018. We retrospectively studied all hospital records of patients who developed ALF after mushroom/drug exposure and had been admitted to our hospital, the main pediatric toxicology center in north-western Romania. RESULTS: In the last 18 years, 123 patients were admitted to our clinic with toxic ALF (89 patients secondary to mushroom ingestion and 34 patients after drug exposure). In the 2000-2012 period accidental mushroom poisoning was the leading cause of toxic ALF. Unfortunately, during the last years, voluntary drug ingestions have increased dramatically. The most commonly incriminated drug was acetaminophen (52.94%). CONCLUSIONS: ALF in mushroom poisoning is associated with a high mortality in children, despite optimal medical therapy. This etiology was one of the most important causes of death in our cohort. The difficulty in accessing emergency liver transplantation is an obstacle common to many Eastern European pediatric centers.

29724247,"Sociodemographic differences in the cultural significance of edible and toxic mushrooms among Tsotsil towns in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico.","BACKGROUND: Mushrooms are important forest resources, mostly as food, despite the serious health threat posed by toxic species. In the Highlands of Chiapas, numerous wild mushroom intoxications have been registered. While Chiapas has been vastly studied from an ethnomycological perspective, no certainty exists as to how nomenclature systems differentiate edible and toxic species, which species are most culturally significant, and whether sociodemographic factors relate to how well-known they are in the Highlands of Chiapas. This paper evaluates which are the most culturally significant edible and toxic wild mushroom species in seven Tsotsil communities from this region and whether differences exist in their knowledge relating to different sociodemographic subsets (gender, schooling, and occupation). The hypothesis that there is a difference in the number of species that people mention, as well as the number of times each ethno-taxon is mentioned, between people from different social groups was tested. METHODS: With consent, 133 Tsotsil people from seven communities were interviewed. Interviews focused on local systematics and free listings of edible and toxic mushrooms. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed, including multivariate methods and non-parametric statistics. RESULTS: Twenty-five edible and 15 toxic taxa were mentioned. Some directly correspond to Linneanean species, while others are subdifferentiated or supradifferentiated. Only 62% of the interviewees named toxic mushrooms. The most frequently mentioned edible taxa were Amanita hayalyuy and A. jacksoniii, Agaricus spp., and Armillaria mellea. The most frequently mentioned toxic species were Amanita muscaria, Suillellus luridus, and Russula emetica. Significant differences in the number of mentioned edible ethnotaxa were found only among different occupations and schooling. The models including schooling interacting with either gender or occupation are better supported. Significant differences in the number of times toxic ethnotaxa are mentioned were found only between men and women. CONCLUSIONS: The Tsotsil region of the Highlands of Chiapas is where the most average mushroom species are recognized state-wide. Schooling and occupation seem most determinant for people to know more or less species of mushrooms, while gender appears irrelevant.

A type of mushroom called Amanita phalloides is responsible for 95% of toxic mushroom poisonings. In this article, we report 2 cases of mushroom poisonings caused by Lactarius volemus, known as Tirmit by the local people. The patient and his wife were admitted to the emergency room with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting 20 hours after consuming Lactarius volemus, an edible type of mushroom. The patients reported that they had been collecting this mushroom from the mountains and eating them for several years but had never developed any clinicopathology to date. Further examination of the patients revealed a very rare case of acute pancreatitis due to mushroom intoxication. The male patient was admitted to the intensive care unit while his wife was followed in the internal medicine service, because of her relative mild clinical symptoms. Both patients recovered without sequelae and were discharged.

During 2008 to 2014, the cases reported to the National Institute of Health included 57 deaths; at least 15 died after ingestion of amanitas, the most common lethal wild mushrooms inhabited. Hence, the aims of this study were to identify mushroom samples from nine clinically reported cases during the 7-year study period based on nuclear ITS sequence data and diagnose lethal peptide toxins using a reversed phase LC-MS method. Nucleotide similarity was identified using BLAST search of the NCBI database and the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD). Clade characterization was performed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic approaches. Based on BLAST and BOLD reference databases our results yielded high nucleotide similarities of poisonous mushroom samples to A. exitialis and A. fuliginea. Detailed phylogenetic analyses showed that all mushroom samples fall into their current classification. Detection of the peptide toxins revealed the presence of amatoxins and phallotoxins in A. exitialis and A. fuliginea. In addition, toxic alpha-amanitin was identified in a new provisional species, Amanita sp.1, with the highest toxin quantity.

26252264,[A rare case of acute renal failure related to amanita proxima ingestion].,"OBJECTIVE: The first cases of acute renal tubulopathy related to Amanita proxima poisoning were described in 1994; the mushroom contains a toxin responsible for the allenic-norleucine syndrome, characterised by a kidney damage that occur earlier than in Cortinarius orellanus poisoning and generally improve with complete resolution within ten days. CASE REPORT: A 45 years old woman was admitted to the hospital because of nausea, vomiting, and heartburn started the day before. Symptoms occurred eight hours after eating a single big wild mushroom; three friends who had the same meal were all asymptomatic. Twelve hours after the admission the woman became anuric and blood tests showed an impaired renal function: creatinine 13 mg/dL urea 240 mg/dL, AST 240 U / L, ALT 350 U / l. The patient was transferred to the nephrology unit of the Hospital Di Venere of Bari and the PCC of Milan was consulted. The toxicologist supposed a nephrotoxic syndrome caused by the consumption of Amanita proxima and sent a picture of the mushroom ingested to a mycologist who identified the specie as Amanita proxima Dume, Bull (typical volva reddish-orange, ivory white hat, scaly stalk) sometimes mistaken for Amanita ovoidea. Haemodialysis was performed for five days followed by supportive care. Urine output gradually increased, serum creatinine decreased and Ast - Alt normalized. CONCLUSIONS: Amanita proxima contains an allenic-norleucine toxin (different from orellanine for the absence of inhibition of alkaline phosphatase), responsible for the reversible kidney damage, characterised by tubulointerstitial nephritis with acute tubular necrosis and renal failure.

Food poisoning by Clitocybe acromelalga, a poisonous mushroom, is known to induce erythromelalgia; however, its treatment protocol remains unclear. We describe here three cases of erythromelalgia following the consumption of C. acromelalga with varying clinical courses.

Patient 2 presented at 3 days after the symptomatic onset and was immediately treated with high-dose intravenous nicotinic acid, with a dramatic symptomatic improvement. Patient 3, who had milder symptoms, spontaneously recovered within a week without any treatment. DISCUSSION: The clinical manifestations and varying clinical courses associated with C. acromelalga toxicity are discussed here, with the pathogenesis of this mycotoxin and a potential treatment. Detailed interviews of such patients are important, particularly because of the remarkably slow course of this mycotoxin as compared with common food poisonings.

22560399,Mushroom poisoning: a study on circumstances of exposure and patterns of toxicity.,"BACKGROUND: Picking wild mushrooms is a popular pastime in Switzerland. Correct identification of the species is difficult for laypersons. Ingestion of toxic mushrooms may result in serious toxicity, including death. The aim of the study is to analyze and describe the circumstances of exposure to mushrooms, and to define the clinical relevance of mushroom poisoning for humans in Central Europe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective case study and analyzed all inquiries concerning human exposures to mushrooms (n = 5638, 1.2% of all inquiries) which were reported to the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre between January 1995 and December 2009. RESULTS: The most frequent reason for contacting the poison center in cases of adult exposure was toxicity resulting from edible species. Pediatric exposure predominantly occurred from mushrooms found around the home. Severe symptoms have not only been observed after ingestion of non-amatoxin-containing toxic mushrooms, i.e. Boletus sp. and Cortinarius sp., but also after meals of edible species. The mortality of confirmed amatoxin poisonings was high (5/32) compared to other reports. CONCLUSIONS: Inquiries regarding mushroom poisoning were a relatively infrequent reason for contacting the poison center. Nevertheless, accidental ingestion of toxic mushrooms can be responsible for severe or fatal poisonings. Although pediatric exposure to mushrooms found around the home has not led to serious toxicity in this study, prevention of exposure is warranted.

21589827,Liver transplantation in Greek children: 15 years experience.,"Liver transplantation (LT) is the only available live-saving procedure for children with irreversible liver failure. This paper reports our experience from the follow-up of 16 Greek children with end-stage liver failure who underwent a LT. Over a period of 15 years, 16 pediatric liver recipients received follow up after being subjected to OLT (orthotopic liver transplantation) due to end-stage liver failure. Nine children initially presented with extrahepatic biliary atresia, 2 with acute liver failure after toxic mushroom ingestion, 2 with intrahepatic cholestasis, 2 with metabolic diseases and one with hepatoblastoma. Ten children received a liver transplant in the Organ Transplantation Unit of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the rest in other transplant centers. Three transplants came from a living-related donor and 13 from a deceased donor. Six children underwent immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids, and 7 with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids.

In the hospital she ate 5g of stewed G. frondosa and 10g of the same fungus boiled with chicken and taro on different days.

Therefore, we concluded that encephalopathy experienced in Akita Prefecture caused by was the cyanogenic fungi such as P. porrigens , G. frondosa, Pleurotus eringii etc. Although the amounts of mushrooms eaten by poisoned subjects were not so clear, we estimated that the amounts of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) taken into human bodies exceeded the detoxication limit of HCN, resulting in HCN poisoning.

16035202,"Use of amifostine, a novel cytoprotective, in alpha-amanitin poisoning.","BACKGROUND: Mortality from ingestions of the mushroom Amanita phalloides remains as high as 20-40% with many surviving patients requiring liver transplantation. A variety of treatments for Amanita ingestion have been evaluated, yet other than supportive measures, no effective therapy has been identified. In addition, an antidote for Amanita toxicity may not be practical due to delayed patient presentation. The drug amifostine was proposed to potentially improve survival from alpha-amanitin toxicity by conferring cytoprotective effects on hepatocytes at risk for cell death. Amifostine is used as a radio--and chemo-protective agent. It protects against lipoperoxidation, interferes with the cross-linking of DNA, and may act by other mechanisms yet to be identified, making it attractive for potentially attenuating ongoing hepatic necrosis. It has not previously been studied in a toxicologic model. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether amifostine is an effective postexposure therapy for alpha-amanitin, the primary lethal toxin in Amanita phalloides. METHODS: Swiss mice (n = 30 in all groups) were given an approximate LD75 dose of intraperitoneal (i.p.) alpha-amanitin.

Mice were monitored and time of death recorded. At day 7, survival was assumed and the remaining mice were euthanized. Qualitative histologic comparisons of hepatic and renal toxicity were performed.

Less information is available on toxic-induced hypoglycemia in non-diabetic subjects with acute exogenous poisoning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied adult non-diabetic patients admitted in Emergency Clinic Hospital of Iasi with hypoglycemia caused by an acute poisoning, over a period of 10 years. Then we performed a prospective study in those poisoning associated with hypoglycemic risk, to assess the prevalence of toxic-induced hypoglycemia. RESULTS: We identified 15,497 patients with acute poisoning in our retrospective study, 4,005 of whom presented poisoning associated with hypoglycemic risk (40% acute ethanol poisoning, 29% wild mushroom poisoning, 23% beta-blocker poisoning, 7% salicylate poisoning and 1% patients with anti-diabetic agents acute poisoning). The prospective study identified 1,034 patients with acute poisoning, 20.11% of whom had ethanol poisoning, 11.79% had beta-blocker poisoning, 5.89% had wild mushroom poisoning, 1.74% had salicylate poisoning and the rest of 60.47% had other acute poisoning, without hypoglycemic risk. Attempted suicide with anti-diabetic agents in non-diabetic subjects produced the most severe and prolonged form of hypoglycemia in acute poisoning. 23 patients in retrospective study and 6 patients in prospective study died, but in only one situation, the death was the direct consequence of hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: In non-diabetic subjects with acute poisoning, prevalence of toxic-induced hypoglycemia depends on the poison itself, the mechanism of poisoning, also depends on the association between toxics and the severity of toxic- induced liver disease. A useful test to assess toxic-induced hypoglycemia is standard 6 hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

Toxin-related disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in the tropical and subtropical continents. Snake bite is the single most important toxin-related disease, causing substantial mortality in many parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The most important snake families are Viperidae and Elapidae, causing a range of clinical effects including local necrosis, neurotoxicity, coagulopathy and hemorrhage, myotoxicity and renal toxicity. These effects vary according to geography and group of snake. Arachnid envenomation results mainly in morbidity, particularly scorpion stings which can cause severe systemic envenomation. Spider bite is far less of a problem, and the majority of medically important cases can be attributed to widow spiders (Latrodectus spp.) and recluse spiders (Loxosceles spp.). Marine-related envenomations are common, but severe effects are less so. Plant and mushroom poisoning occur in most parts of the world, but the types and methods of poisoning vary considerably between continents. Management of toxin-related disease is often difficult, and in many cases meticulous supportive care is all that is available. The mainstay of treatment is the use of antivenoms for many envenomations and poisoning, although these do not exist for all dangerous organisms. Unfortunately antivenoms are not an economically viable product, so development and manufacture of these agents have been limited. This is now further worsened by a current shortage of antivenom. There is a need for improvement in the preventionand management of toxin-related disease. This will require well-designed studies to define the extent of the problem, initiatives to improve the prevention and management of these conditions, and development of new, and continuation of current, antivenom supplies.",Journal of toxicology.

9425124,Induction of calreticulin expression in response to amino acid deprivation in Chinese hamster ovary cells.,"The role of calreticulin as a stress-induced molecular chaperone protein of the endoplasmic reticulum is becoming more apparent. We characterize here the induction of calreticulin in response to complete amino acid deprivation in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Amino acid deprivation caused a 4-fold increase in calreticulin protein levels over a period of 4-10 h. In addition to an overall increase in protein levels, the glycosylation of calreticulin was increased. This glycosylation event was blocked by tunicamycin and was not required for the increase in calreticulin protein levels. Immunofluorescence studies localized calreticulin to the ER of CHO cells, and no significant change was observed after amino acid deprivation. Northern-blot analysis showed that calreticulin mRNA levels were increased approx. 10-fold in response to complete amino acid deprivation. The response was sensitive to actinomycin D and alpha-amanitin, implying that regulation is primarily at the level of transcription.

Delay in onset of symptoms, individual susceptibility variation and lack of rapid and reliable identification have contributed to the significant morbidity and mortality of this type of poisoning.A rapid chromatographic assay for identifying the potent cytotoxins and apparently successful management using thioctic acid of two cases of A. phalloides-type mushroom poisoning are reported. All known cases of A. phalloides-type mushroom poisoning treated with thioctic acid in the United States are summarized.",-1
1239959,Roentgenographic features of mushroom (Amanita) poisoning.,"The clinical and roentgenographic features of six cases of Amanita mushroom poisoning were reviewed. The roentgenographic manifestations included adynamic ileus (three patients) and small, irregularly shaped kidneys secondary to the healing process of acute tubular necrosis (one patient). Intestinal pseudo-obstruction can result from many medical problems and mushroom poisoning should be considered in its differential diagnosis.","The American journal of roentgenology, radium therapy, and nuclear medicine",1975,Hanelin LG; Moss AA,,Acute Kidney Injury/diagnosis/etiology; Adult; *Agaricales; Aged; *Amanita; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction/diagnosis/etiology; Male; Mushroom Poisoning/complications/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging; Necrosis; Radiography; Uremia/etiology,Case Reports; Journal Article,Roentgenographic features of mushroom (Amanita) poisoning.,"The clinical and roentgenographic features of six cases of Amanita mushroom poisoning were reviewed.

By means of these antibodies, a radioimmunoassay was developed which allows detection of as little as 0.5 ng of amanitins in 1 ml of serum. By this method, the clearance of alpha-amanitin from the blood of poisoned mice was measured.",Experientia,1975,Fiume L; Busi C; Campadelli-Fiume G; Franceschi C,,Amanitins/blood/*immunology; Animals; Freund's Adjuvant; Male; Mice; Rabbits; Radioimmunoassay/methods; Rats/immunology; Serum Albumin,Journal Article,Production of antibodies to amanitins as the basis for their radioimmunoassay.,"The production of antibodies against amanitins is described.

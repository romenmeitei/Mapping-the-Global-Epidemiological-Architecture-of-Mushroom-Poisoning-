The kinetics of alpha and beta amanitin were studied in 45 patients intoxicated with Amanita Phalloides. The amatoxins were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography in plasma (43 cases), urine (35 cases), gastroduodenal fluid (12 cases), feces (12 cases) and tissues (4 cases). All patients had gastrointestinal symptoms and 43 developed an acute hepatitis. Two patients underwent successful liver transplantation. Eight patients, of whom three were children, died. The detection of amatoxins in the biological fluids was time dependent. The first sample was obtained at an average of 37.9 h post ingestion in the patients with positive results and at 70.6 h in the samples without detectable amatoxins. Plasma amatoxins were detected in 11 cases at 8 to 190 ng/mL for alpha and between 23.5 to 162 ng/mL for beta. In 23 cases amatoxins were detected in urine with a mean excretion per hour of 32.18 micrograms for alpha and 80.15 micrograms for beta. In 10 patients the total amounts eliminated in the feces (time variable) ranged between 8.4 and 152 micrograms for alpha amanitin and between 4.2 and 6270 micrograms for beta amanitin. In three of four cases amatoxins were still present in the liver and the kidney after day 5. Amatoxins were usually detectable in plasma before 36 h but were present in the urine until day 4. The rapid clearance indicates that enhanced elimination of amatoxins requires early treatment. Clearance of circulating amatoxins by day 4 spares the transplanted liver.', 'A Case Study: What Doses of Amanita phalloides and Amatoxins Are Lethal to Humans?. There are few data estimating the human lethal dose of amatoxins or of the toxin level present in ingested raw poisonous mushrooms. Here, we present a patient who intentionally ingested several wild collected mushrooms to assess whether they were poisonous. Nearly 1 day after ingestion, during which the patient had nausea and vomiting, he presented at the emergency department. His transaminase levels started to increase starting from hour 48 and peaking at hour 72 (alanine aminotransferase 2496 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase 1777 IU/L). A toxin analysis was carried out on the mushrooms that the patient said he had ingested. With reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, an uptake of approximately 21.3 mg amatoxin from nearly 50 g mushroom was calculated; it consisted of 11.9 mg alpha amanitin, 8.4 mg beta amanitin, and 1 mg gamma amanitin. In the urine sample taken on day 4, 2.7 ng/mL alpha amanitin and 1.25 ng/mL beta amanitin were found, and there was no gamma amanitin. Our findings suggest that the patient ingested approximately 0.32 mg/kg amatoxin, and fortunately recovered after serious hepatotoxicity developed.', 'Mushroom poisoning: a retrospective study concerning 11-years of admissions in a Swiss Emergency Department.. Wild mushroom intoxication is an unusual cause of toxic ingestion in Europe. A great diversity of clinical symptoms may arise depending on the variety of wild mushrooms ingested. These initial symptoms are often non-specific, with frequent gastrointestinal symptoms, and have no direct correlation with the outcome. Therefore, management of mushroom poisoning and risk evaluation are a challenge for emergency clinicians. We retrospectively reviewed all cases of mushroom poisoning identified in the ED database spanning 11 years. Demographic and clinical data, time from consumption to symptoms, type of mushrooms, the number of patients presenting at the same time, treatment(s) provided, length of stay, discharge diagnosis, in-hospital mortality, and serious complications were evaluated. We identify 87 cases of mushroom poisoning. The most common symptoms are nausea and vomiting (71 cases, 82%), followed by diarrhea (68%), syncope (10%), abdominal pain (8%), and hallucinations (7%). Sixty-four patients (74%) exhibited early symptoms (appearance <6 h after ingestion) and 23 (26%) late symptoms (appearance >6 h after ingestion). Eleven patients (13%) required hospitalization over 24 h. Patients with late symptoms tended to have longer in-hospital lengths of stay. Only one patient had Amanita phalloides intoxication, with a favorable outcome. Thirty-eight patients (44%) were involved in cluster presentations. Mushroom poisoning is an unusual but potentially severe form of intoxication. Patients presenting with late-appearing symptoms (>6 h) are associated with a higher risk of A. phalloides intoxication, and therefore require specific investigation and management.']"

Wild mushroom poisoning from the genus Amanita is a medical emergency, with Amanita phalloides being the most common offender. Patients may complain of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or abdominal pain. If not aggressively treated, fulminant hepatic failure may develop within several days of ingestion. In this case report, a patient poisoned with Amanita bisporigera is described, along with the typical clinical presentation, patient outcomes, and treatment options for dealing with an Amanita mushroom poisoning.', 'Mushroom poisoning--from diarrhea to liver transplantation.. Mushroom poisoning from the genus Amanita is a medical emergency, with Amanita phalloides being the most common species. The typical symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are nonspecific and can be mistaken for gastroenteritis. If not adequately treated, hepatic and renal failure may ensue within several days of ingestion. In this case series, patients poisoned with Amanita virosa are described with a spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes ranging from complete recovery to fulminant hepatic failure. Although there are no controlled clinical trials, a few anecdotal studies provide the basis for regimens recommended to treat Amanita poisoning. Use of i.v. penicillin G is supported by most reports. Silibinin, although preferred over penicillin, is not easily available in the United States. In those with acute liver failure, liver transplantation can be life saving.', '[Liver failure due to mushroom poisoning: clinical course and new treatment perspectives].. Mushroom poisoning, mainly due to the Amanita genus, is an infrequent cause of liver failure in our environment. However, because of its high morbidity and mortality, it constitutes a medical emergency. The characteristic initial symptoms of vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are nonspecific and may be confused with gastroenteritis. If correct and early treatment is not given, renal and hepatic failure can develop, sometimes requiring liver transplantation. We present three cases of mushroom poisoning, which presented a different clinical course ranging from complete recovery with traditional medical treatment to severe acute liver failure requiring transplantation in one patient and albumin dialysis (molecular absorbent recycling system [MARS]) in another with favorable outcome. Although controlled clinical studies of the treatment of mushroom poisoning are lacking, recommendations based on the experience of various authors have been established. Penicillin G and silymarin seem to be useful. The development of new techniques of extracorporeal detoxification, mainly MARS, may represent an important support system in the treatment of these patients.']"

BACKGROUND: Mushrooms are important forest resources, mostly as food, despite the serious health threat posed by toxic species. In the Highlands of Chiapas, numerous wild mushroom intoxications have been registered. While Chiapas has been vastly studied from an ethnomycological perspective, no certainty exists as to how nomenclature systems differentiate edible and toxic species, which species are most culturally significant, and whether sociodemographic factors relate to how well-known they are in the Highlands of Chiapas. This paper evaluates which are the most culturally significant edible and toxic wild mushroom species in seven Tsotsil communities from this region and whether differences exist in their knowledge relating to different sociodemographic subsets (gender, schooling, and occupation). The hypothesis that there is a difference in the number of species that people mention, as well as the number of times each ethno-taxon is mentioned, between people from different social groups was tested. METHODS: With consent, 133 Tsotsil people from seven communities were interviewed. Interviews focused on local systematics and free listings of edible and toxic mushrooms. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed, including multivariate methods and non-parametric statistics. RESULTS: Twenty-five edible and 15 toxic taxa were mentioned. Some directly correspond to Linneanean species, while others are subdifferentiated or supradifferentiated. Only 62% of the interviewees named toxic mushrooms. The most frequently mentioned edible taxa were Amanita hayalyuy and A. jacksoniii, Agaricus spp., and Armillaria mellea. The most frequently mentioned toxic species were Amanita muscaria, Suillellus luridus, and Russula emetica. Significant differences in the number of mentioned edible ethnotaxa were found only among different occupations and schooling. The models including schooling interacting with either gender or occupation are better supported. Significant differences in the number of times toxic ethnotaxa are mentioned were found only between men and women. CONCLUSIONS: The Tsotsil region of the Highlands of Chiapas is where the most average mushroom species are recognized state-wide. Schooling and occupation seem most determinant for people to know more or less species of mushrooms, while gender appears irrelevant. People with no studies and field-related occupations name more species. Identification criteria to distinguish edible from toxic species seem to rest not on detailed recognition of the second set but precise knowledge of the first.', '[An incident of toadstool poisoning].. Objective: To investigate a poisonous mushroom poisoning incident and analyze its clinical data. Methods: Investigate a poisonous mushroom poisoning incident in a place in Shandong in July 2018, at the same time, the clinical data of 2 cases of mushroom poisoning were analyzed and summarized. Results: The incident was caused by a poisoning incident caused by residents eating poisonous mushrooms. The poisonous mushroom in this incident was identified as a scaled white goose cream. Two patients with poisoning developed gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and liver damage occurred later. After active rescue and treatment, one patient was discharged from hospital, and the other patient developed acute pulmonary embolism during the treatment. He was discharged after interventional thrombolysis and follow-up treatment. Conclusion: After investigation, the incident was caused by the ingestion of poisonous mushrooms mainly based on the scalloped white goose cream. After active treatment, they were cured and discharged.', ""Surveillance of household foodborne disease outbreaks in Zhejiang Province, China, 2010-2022.. BACKGROUND: Foodborne diseases are a growing public health concern worldwide and households are a common setting. This study aimed to explore the epidemiological characteristics of household foodborne disease outbreaks in Zhejiang Province and propose targeted prevention and control measures. METHODS: Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze household foodborne disease outbreak data collected from the Foodborne Disease Outbreaks Surveillance System in Zhejiang Province from 2010 to 2022. RESULTS: Household foodborne disease outbreaks showed an upward trend during the study period (Cox-Staurt trend test, p = 0.01563 < 0.05). These outbreaks mainly occurred from June to September, with 62.08% (352/567) of all reported outbreaks. The number of reported outbreaks varied in 11 prefectures, with a maximum of 100 and a minimum of only 7. Household foodborne disease outbreaks had a wide spectrum of etiologic factors. Mushroom toxins accounted for the largest proportion of all etiologies (43.39 %) and caused the highest proportion of hospitalization (54.18%) and death (78.26%). Such outbreaks are caused by accidently eating wild poisonous mushrooms. Bacterial infection (16.23%) was the second most common etiology, with Salmonella spp. and Vibrio parahaemolyticus being the primary pathogens. These outbreaks were caused by improper storage, improper processing or a combination of factors, and the foods involved were mainly aquatic animals, eggs and cooked meat. Other identified etiologies included plant toxins (9.52%), chemicals (7.23%), animal toxins (3.70%), and viruses (1.76%). Among the above-mentioned etiologies, mushroom toxins, bacteria, and animal toxins had seasonal characteristics. Analysis of regions and etiologies revealed that the proportion of various etiologies was different in 11 prefectures. Wild mushrooms (43.39%), aquatic animals (9.88%), and toxic plants (8.47%) were the top three foods involved in these outbreaks. The most common factors contributing to household foodborne disease outbreaks were inedibility and misuse (59.08%), followed by multiple factors (7.58%), improper storage (7.41%), and improper processing (7.41%). CONCLUSIONS: Household foodborne disease outbreaks were closely related to the lack of knowledge regarding foodborne disease prevention. Therefore, public health agencies should strengthen residents' surveillance and health education to improve food safety awareness and effectively reduce foodborne diseases in households. In addition, timely publicity and early warning by relevant government departments, the introduction of standards to control the contamination of pathogenic bacteria in raw materials, and strengthened supervision of the sale of substances that may cause health hazards, such as poisonous mushrooms and nitrites, will also help reduce such outbreaks.""]"

INTRODUCTION: Mushroom poisoning is not new to Nepal. Undocumented and unrecorded mushroom poisoning is more common than the published one. We evaluated the pattern and outcomes following toxic mushroom ingestions. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with mushroom poisoning in BPKIHS, a tertiary care hospital in Nepal, from 2002 to 2006. The diagnosis of mushroom poisoning was based on history and clinical presentation. RESULTS: Twenty seven patients, aged between 7-83 years were studied. Fourteen (51.86%) were male and 13 (48.14%) were female. All (100%) patients had consumed wild mushroom unintentionally. Twelve patients developed symptoms within first hour and 11 patients within one to six hours. The average delay in presenting to our hospital was 23.1 (2-96) hours. In 10 cases, other family members were affected, out of which in two cases the family members had died in other hospitals. Reported symptoms were nausea 27 (100%), vomiting 24 (88.88%), abdominal cramping 8 (29.6%), jaundice 3 (11.1%), diarrhea 17 (62.96%) and altered sensorium in 8 patients (29.65%). All patients were treated conservatively. Three patients with severe hepatitis were admitted in ICU, out of which two recovered without liver transplant. One eight year old boy developed acute liver failure and expired within 24 hours of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the mushroom poisoning was acute, unintentional and by consumption of wild mushroom. Community based awareness programs will help prevent the instances of poisoning.', 'Toxic-induced hypoglycemia in clinical practice.. Toxic induced hypoglycemia is usually caused by the anti-diabetic treatment and excessive alcohol consume. Hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin or anti-diabetic oral agents is far the most studied form of hypoglycemia. Less information is available on toxic-induced hypoglycemia in non-diabetic subjects with acute exogenous poisoning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied adult non-diabetic patients admitted in Emergency Clinic Hospital of Iasi with hypoglycemia caused by an acute poisoning, over a period of 10 years. Then we performed a prospective study in those poisoning associated with hypoglycemic risk, to assess the prevalence of toxic-induced hypoglycemia. RESULTS: We identified 15,497 patients with acute poisoning in our retrospective study, 4,005 of whom presented poisoning associated with hypoglycemic risk (40% acute ethanol poisoning, 29% wild mushroom poisoning, 23% beta-blocker poisoning, 7% salicylate poisoning and 1% patients with anti-diabetic agents acute poisoning). The prospective study identified 1,034 patients with acute poisoning, 20.11% of whom had ethanol poisoning, 11.79% had beta-blocker poisoning, 5.89% had wild mushroom poisoning, 1.74% had salicylate poisoning and the rest of 60.47% had other acute poisoning, without hypoglycemic risk. Attempted suicide with anti-diabetic agents in non-diabetic subjects produced the most severe and prolonged form of hypoglycemia in acute poisoning. 23 patients in retrospective study and 6 patients in prospective study died, but in only one situation, the death was the direct consequence of hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: In non-diabetic subjects with acute poisoning, prevalence of toxic-induced hypoglycemia depends on the poison itself, the mechanism of poisoning, also depends on the association between toxics and the severity of toxic- induced liver disease. A useful test to assess toxic-induced hypoglycemia is standard 6 hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Factors predicting a negative outcome in toxic-induced hypoglycemia are association of toxins, cardiac and hepatic complications, and age (>65 years).', 'Delayed liver toxicity and delayed gastroenteritis: A 5 year retrospective analysis of the cause of death in Mushroom poisoning.. INTRODUCTION: Mushroom poisoning occurs from consumption of the wild variants of mushroom containing varied forms of toxins. Among those toxins, amatoxin containing mushrooms are known for the significant morbidity and mortality from hepatic toxicity and delayed gastroenteritis. Although not a very common cause of poisoning, it is prevalent in the north-eastern region of India, especially during the rainy summer seasons when the wild variants are found abundantly and often confused with the edible variants. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical and biochemical profiles and short term outcomes of patients with mushroom poisoning admitted to a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the data of patients with mushroom poisoning admitted to a tertiary care institute in north-eastern India between January 2015 to December 2020 to study their clinical and biochemical profiles, and short-term outcomes. Their clinical features, biochemical parameters, management, and in-hospital outcomes were noted. All data was recorded in Microsoft MS Excel and analyses done using SPSS version 22. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients with mushroom poisoning, 23 (52%) were male and 21 (47%) were female, with a mean age of 20.13 years. Seventeen patients (38%) had delayed liver failure and delayed gastroenteritis, 19 patients (43%) had acute gastroenteritis syndrome, 5 patients (11%) had cholinergic symptoms, one patient (2%) each had acute kidney injury and a disulfiram-type reaction with headache. The mean hospital stay of the patients was 5 days. In-hospital mortality occurred in 10 (58%) patients with delayed liver failure and none of the patients with the other complications died. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high prevalence of mushroom poisoning that caused delayed liver toxicity and delayed gastroenteritis, probably amatoxin-induced, which is fatal, thus accounting for high mortality and poor outcomes in these patients.']"
